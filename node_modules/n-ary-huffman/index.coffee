  # A `numBranches`-ary tree can be formed by `1 + (numBranches - 1) * n`
  # elements: There is the root of the tree (`1`), and each branch point adds
  # `numBranches` elements to the total number or elements, but replaces itself
  # (`numBranches - 1`). `n` is the number of points where the tree branches
  # (therefore, `n` is an integer). In order to create the tree using
  # `numElements` elements, we need to find the smallest `n` such that `1 +
  # (numBranches - 1) * n == numElements + padding`. We need to add `padding`
  # since `n` is an integer and there might not be an integer `n` that makes
  # the left-hand side equal to `numElements`. Solving for `padding` gives
  # `padding = 1 + (numBranches - 1) * n - numElements`. Since `padding >= 0`
  # (we won’t reduce the number of elements, only add extra dummy ones), it
  # follows that `n >= (numElements - 1) / (numBranches - 1)`. The smallest
  # integer `n = numBranchPoints` is then:
  numBranchPoints = Math.ceil((numElements - 1) / (numBranches - 1))
  # The above gives the padding:
  numPadding = 1 + (numBranches - 1) * numBranchPoints - numElements

  # All the `numBranchPoints` branch points will be stored in this array instead
  # of splicing them into the `elements` array. This way we do not need to
  # search for the correct index to maintain the sort order. This array, and all
  # other below, are created with the correct length from the beginning for
  # performance.
