gravitation the classical m bius function mu n is an important multiplicative function in number theory and combinatorics it is named in honor of the german mathematician august ferdinand m bius who first introduced it in one eight three one this classical m bius function is a special case of a more general object in combinatorics definition n is defined for all positive natural numbers n and has its values in depending on the factorization of n into prime factors it is defined as follows n one if n is a square free positive integer with an even number of distinct prime factors n one if n is a square free positive integer with an odd number of distinct prime factors n zero if n is not square free this is taken to imply that one one the value of zero is generally left undefined but the maple computer algebra system for example returns one for this value the five zero first values of the function are plotted below the five zero first values of the function properties and applications the m bius function is multiplicative i e ab a b whenever a and b are coprime the sum over all positive divisors of n of the m bius function is zero except when n one sum mu d left one is of relevance in the theory of multiplicative and arithmetic functions other applications of n in combinatorics are connected with the use of the polya theorem in combinatorial groups and combinatorial enumerations in number theory another arithmetic function closely related to the m bius function is the mertens function it is defined by m n sum n mu k for every natural number n this function is closely linked with the positions of zeroes of the riemann zeta function see the article on the mertens conjecture for more information about the connection between m n and the riemann hypothesis if n is a sphenic number

encyclopedia of integer sequences multiplicative functions methadone is a synthetic opioid analgesic synthesized in one nine three seven by german scientists max bockm hl and gustav ehrhart at ig farben hoechst am main who were searching for an analgesic that would be easier to use during surgery and also have low addiction potential methadone is a schedule ii drug under the single convention on narcotic drugs on september one one one nine four one bockm hl and ehrhart filed an application for a patent for a synthetic substance they called hoechst one zero eight two zero or polamidon and whose structure had no relation to morphine or the opioid alkaloids bockm hl and ehrhart one nine four nine although chemically unlike morphine or heroin methadone also acts on the opioid receptors and thus produces many of the same effects chemically methadone is the simplest of the opioids methadone was introduced into the united states in one nine four seven by eli lilly and company as an analgesic they gave it the trade name dolophine which is now registered to roxane laboratories since then it has been best known for its use in treating narcotic addiction though it is also used in managing chronic pain due to its long duration of action and very low cost in late two zero zero four the cost of a one month supply of methadone is two zero usd as compared to an equivalent analgesic amount of demerol at one two zero usd the old name dolophine comes from the german dolphium the name derives from the latin dolor pain methadone as dolophine was first manufactured in the usa by mallinckrodt pharmaceuticals a st louis based subsidiary of the tyco international corporation mallinckrodt held the patent up until the early one nine nine zero s today a number of pharmaceutical companies produce and distribute methadone however the major producer remains mallinckrodt mallinckrodt sells bulk methadone to most of the producers of generic preparations and also distributes its own brand name product in the form of tablets dispersable tablets and oral concentrate under the name methadose in the united states generally one will only hear dolophine used by older addicts who used the product in the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s medical professionals who believe that dolophine is the generic name for methadone when actually it is the reverse may also use the old brand name methadone has a slow metabolism and very high lipid solubility making it longer lasting than morphine based drugs methadone has a typical half life of two four four eight hours permitting the administration only once a day in heroin detoxification and maintenance programs the most common mode of delivery at a methadone clinic is in an oral solution methadone is almost as effective when administered orally as by injection just like heroin tolerance and dependence frequently develop current research in this area shows methadone has a unique affinity for the nmda brain receptor some researchers propose that nmda n methyl d aspartic acid may regulate psychic dependence and tolerance by exhibiting opioid antagonist like activity withdrawal symptoms are generally less acutely severe than those of morphine and heroin at equivalent doses but are significantly more prolonged considered generally effective in management of heroin addiction and harm reduction reduction of hiv rates etc at proper dosing it reduces the appetite for heroin however some heroin addicts feel that it is actually harder to quit methadone than heroin itself treatment at a methadone maintenance clinic is intended to be for an indefinite duration as the treatment is not curative in recent years methadone has gained popularity among physicians for the treatment of chronic pain the increased usage comes as doctors search for an opioid drug that can be dosed less frequently than short acting drugs such as morphine or hydrocodone methadone with its long half life oral bioavailability and long duration of effect is a common second choice drug for pain that doesn t respond to weaker agonists although not common methadone is encountered on the illicit market and has been associated with a number of overdose deaths street meth demand comes primarily from opioid addicts unable to get into a legal methadone program addicts seeking a high strongly prefer shorter acting opioids studies have shown that the vast majority of methadone diverted to the illicit market comes from pain management prescriptions or theft from factories shippers not from maintenance patients closely related to methadone the synthetic compound levo alphacetylmethadol or laam orlaam has an even longer duration of action from four eight to seven two hours permitting a reduction in frequency of use in one nine nine four it was approved as a treatment of narcotic addiction like methadone laam is in schedule ii of the united states controlled substances act laam has since been removed from the us and european markets due to reports of rare cardiac side effects buprenorphine has also been used in the treatment of narcotic addiction in october two zero zero two the fda approved two compounds containing buprenorphine subutex and suboxone for the treatment of narcotic addiction it is interesting to note that subutex and suboxone are in schedule iii of the united states controlled substances act which allow for their use on an outpatient basis unlike methadone and laam in the uk and many other countries however not only buprenorphine and methadone but also diamorphine heroin and other opioids are regularly used for outpatient treatment of opiate addiction and treatment is generally provided in much less heavily regulated environments than in the united states a recent study from austria indicated that oral morphine provides better results than oral methadone and studies of heroin maintenance have indicated that a low background dose of methadone combined with heroin maintenance may significantly improve outcomes for less responsive patients another close relative of methadone is dextropropoxyphene first marketed in one nine five seven under the trade name of darvon oral analgesic potency is one half to one third that of codeine with six five mg approximately equivalent to about six zero zero mg of aspirin dextropropoxyphene is prescribed

one nine th century by august ferdinand m bius it was later generalized to other m bius inversion formulas see incidence algebra the classic version states that if g n and f n are arithmetic functions satisfying g n sum f d quad mboxn ge one then f n sum g d mu n d quad mboxn ge one where is the m bius function and the sums extend over all positive divisors d of n in effect the original f n can be determined given g n by using the inversion formula the two sequences are said to be m bius transforms of each other the formula is also correct if f and g are functions from the positive integers into some abelian group in the language of convolutions see multiplicative function and dirichlet convolution the inversion formula can also be expressed as one an equivalent formulation of the inversion formula more useful in combinatorics is as follows suppose f x and g x are complex valued functions defined on the interval one such that g x sum f x n quad mboxx ge one then f x sum mu n g x n quad mboxx ge one here the sums extend over all positive integers n which are less than or equal to x the m bius inversion treated above is the original m bius inversion when the partially ordered set of natural numbers ordered by divisibility one is replaced by other locally finite partially ordered sets one has other m bius inversion formulas for an account of those see incidence algebra common functions a series of functions on the positive integers can be defined by the transform in the first equation above if one starts with euler s totient function and repeatedly apply the transformation process the following functions are the result one phi n totient function two f n n identity function three sigma n divisor function if the starting function is the m bius function itself the list of functions is one mu n m bius function two epsilon n begin one mboxn mbox zero mboxn end the unit function also written as u n three f n one constant function one four tau n number of divisors of n see divisor function both of these lists of functions extend infinitely in both directions the m bius inversion formula enables these lists to be traversed backwards physics

varying degrees of success an attempted superhero revival in one nine five three five four with the human torch the sub mariner and captain america failed from one nine five two to late one nine five

early one nine six zero s particularly with the justice league of america marvel decided to follow suit editor writer stan lee and freelance artist jack kirby created the fantastic four vaguely reminding one of dc s adventuring quartet the challengers of the unknown the book was a success and marvel began publishing further superhero titles featuring such heroes and anti heroes as the hulk spider man the mighty thor ant man iron man the x men and daredevil and such memorable antagonists as doctor doom magneto galactus the green goblin and doctor octopus the most successful new series was the amazing spider man by stan lee and steve ditko marvel s comics were noted for focusing on characterization to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them this was true of spider man in particular its young hero suffered from self doubt and mundane problems like any other teenager marvel superheroes are often flawed freaks and misfits unlike the perfect handsome athletic heroes found in previous traditional comic books some of the marvel heroes looked like villains and monsters in time this non traditional approach would revolutionize comic books in an october one

superhero in the late one nine five zero s and early one nine six zero s it had run into a creative drought by the decade s end there was a new audience for comics now and it wasn t just the little kids that traditionally had read the books the marvel of the one nine six zero s was in its own way the counterpart of the french new wave marvel was pioneering new methods of comics storytelling and characterization addressing more serious themes and in the process keeping and attracting readers in their teens and beyond moreover among this new generation of readers were people who wanted to write or draw comics themselves within the new style that marvel had pioneered and push the creative envelope still further lee became one of the best known names in comics with his charming personality and relentless salesmanship of the company the voice of stan lee is what one senses in so many of the marvel comics of the first half of the one nine six zero s his sense of humor and generally lighthearted manner and the depiction of the bullpen lee s name for the staff as one big happy family it later became clear the artists often had as much to do with marvel s product and success as lee jack kirby in particular is often credited as the creative well from which sprang many of the cosmic ideas and characters of fantastic four and the mighty thor such as the watcher the silver surfer and ego the living planet while steve ditko is recognized as the driving artistic force behind the moody atmosphere and street level naturalism of spider man and the surreal atmosphere of dr strange lee however continues to deserve great credit for his well honed skills at dialog and story sense for his keen hand at choosing and motivating artists and assembling creative teams and for his uncanny ability to connect with the readers in one nine six eight company founder martin goodman sold marvel comics and his other publishing businesses to the perfect film and chemical

oversaw the company during another slow time for the industry once again marvel attempted to diversify and achieved moderate success with titles themed to horror tomb of dracula martial arts shang chi master of kung fu sword and sorcery conan the barbarian red sonja satire howard the duck and science fiction killraven in amazing adventures some of these were published in larger sized black and white magazines targeted for mature readers marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line even more importantly during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux marvel captured a significant piece of dc s market share by offering a lower priced product with a higher distributor discount in one nine seven three perfect film and chemical corporation changed its name to cadence industries which in turn renamed magazine management co as marvel comics group goodman now completely disconnected from marvel created a new company called atlas seaboard comics in one nine seven four reviving marvel s old atlas name but this project lasted only a year and a half in the mid one nine seven zero s marvel was affected by a decline of the newsstand distribution network cult hits such as howard the duck were the victims of the distribution problems with some titles reporting low sales when in fact they were being resold at a later date in the first specialty comic book stores an attempt by marvel to buy dc was frustrated by dc s refusal to sell its entire library of characters wanting to retain control of superman and batman and dc was sold to warner communications instead by the end of the decade marvel s fortunes were reviving thanks to the rise of direct market distribution selling through those same comics specialty stores instead of newsstands and the sales increase of previously borderline books such as the canceled six

renaissance included institutionalizing creator royalties starting the epic imprint for creator owned material in one nine eight two and launching a brand new albeit ultimately unsuccessful line named new universe to commemorate marvel s two five th anniversary in one nine eight six however shooter was responsible for the introduction of the company wide crossover contest of champions secret wars and was accused by many creators especially near the end of his tenure of exercising his job in a draconian manner and interfering with the writers creative process in one nine eight one marvel purchased the depatie freleng enterprises animation studio from famed looney tunes director friz freleng and his business partner david h depatie the company was renamed marvel productions ltd and it produced well known animated tv series and movies featuring such characters as g i joe the transformers jim henson s muppet babies and dungeons black the characters returned to the marvel universe

and again began diversifying its offerings in two zero zero one marvel withdrew from the comics code authority and established its own marvel ratings system for comics it also created new imprints such as max a line intended for mature readers and marvel age developed for younger audiences including children in addition to this is the highly successful ultimate marvel imprint which allowed marvel to reboot their major titles by deconstructing and updating their major superhero and villain characters to introduce to a new generation this imprint exists in a universe parallel to the proper marvel continuity which allowed the writers freedom from the characters convoluted history and the ability to redesign them and to maintain their other ongoing series without replacing the established continuity this also allowed marvel to capitalize on an influx of new readers who were not familiar with comics but became familiar with their characters through their film franchises making it easier for a mainstream audience to follow the company has also revamped its graphic novel division establishing a bigger presence in the bookstore market marvel remains a key publisher in the comics business even as the industry has dwindled to a fraction of its peak size decades earlier stan lee is no longer officially connected to the company save for the title of chairman emeritus but remains a visible face in the industry and occasionally remarks on his fondness for the characters in two zero zero two he sued successfully for a share of income related to movies and merchandising of marvel characters based on a contract between lee and marvel from the late one nine nine zero s according to court documents marvel had used hollywood accounting to claim that those projects earnings were not profits regardless marvel has also become a key player in hollywood with many of its characters being turned into successful film franchises with perhaps the best examples being x men starting in two zero zero zero and spider man beginning in two zero zero two marvel has announced that it will have a set of five tentpole events in two zero zero six specifying two annihilation which will deal with space cosmic characters and civil war which will deal with a civil war within the marvel universe over superhero registration editors in chief the marvel editor in chief oversees the largest scale creative decisions taken within the company while the fabled stan lee held great authority during the decades when publisher martin goodman privately held his company of which the comics division was a relatively small part his successors have been to greater and lesser extents subject to corporate management the position evolved sporadically in the earliest years the company had a single editor overseeing the entire line as the company grew it became increasingly common for individual titles to be overseen separately the concept of the writer editor evolved stemming from when lee wrote and managed most of the line s output overseeing the line in the one nine seven zero s was a series of chief editors though the titles were used intermittently confusing matters further some appear to have been appointed merely by extending their existing editorial duties by the time jim shooter took the post in one nine seven eight the position of editor in chief was clearly defined in one nine nine four marvel briefly abolished the position replacing tom defalco with five group editors though each held the title editor in chief and had some editors underneath

mutation which is a sudden structural change within the dna of a gene or chromosome of an organism resulting in the creation of a new character or trait not found in the parental type in an organism or individual the new character or trait may or may not be trivial but it is rarely beneficial and will usually result in either a genetic disorder or have no observable effect whatsoever occasionally a body cell in a healthy organism may acquire a mutation caused by a genetic error occurring during routine cell division such an error may result in cancer one of the most famous mutants is the blue

arrest in one nine nine three hale attended bradley university and received a degree in political science in one nine nine six hale took over the church of the creator a racist religious group that worships the white race as creators of civilization the church believes that a racial holy war is necessary to attain a white world without jews and non whites and to this end they encourage their members to populate the lands of this earth with white people exclusively prior to hale s leadership members of the church had committed violent criminal acts including the murder of an african american gulf war veteran the firebombing of an naacp office in washington state and an attempted bombing of a maryland law enforcement officer s home after hale was appointed pontifex maximus supreme leader he changed the name of the organization to the world church of the creator the name was changed again to the creativity movement when a religious group in oregon the church of the creator sued

who was shot as he was on his way to church smith wounded nine others before committing suicide on july five mark potok director of intelligence for the southern poverty law center believes that smith may have acted in retaliation after hale s application to practice law was rejected after smith s shooting spree hale appeared on television and in newspapers saying we do urge hatred if you love something you must be willing to hate that which threatens it he also referred to non whites as mud races according to hale america should only be occupied by whites but he never explained to the media how he was going to achieve these goals during a television interview that summer hale stated that his church didn t condone violent or illegal activities meanwhile hale was distributing thousands of copies of the white man s bible a book which encouraged a war against jews and inferior colored races in public hale claimed to be against violence but his church s bibles expressed the opposite sentiment you have no alibi no other way out white man it s fight or die hale s reactions to smith s shooting spree were also recorded by a police informant and on the tapes hale laughs about

from illinois meritocracy is as the suffix cracy implies a system of government based on rule by ability merit rather than by wealth race or other determinants of social position however the word meritocracy is now often used to describe a type of society where wealth income and social status are assigned through competition on the assumption that the winners do indeed deserve merit their resulting advantage as a result the word has acquired a connotation of social darwinism and is used to describe aggressively competitive societies with large inequality of income and wealth contrasted with egalitarian societies meritocratic governments and organizations stress talent formal education and competence rather than existing differences such as social class ethnicity or sex in practice research on social mobility indicates that all these supposedly neutral criteria favour the children of those who are already privileged in some way in a representative democracy where power is theoretically in the hands of the elected representatives meritocratic elements include the use of expert consultants to help formulate policies and a meritocratic civil service to implement them the perennial problem in advocating meritocracy is defining exactly what one means by merit origin of term the term was first used in a pejorative sense in michael young s one nine five eight book rise of the meritocracy which is set in a dystopian future in which one s social place is determined by iq plus effort in the book this social system ultimately leads to a social revolution in which the masses overthrow the elite who have become arrogant and disconnected from the feelings of the public despite the negative origin of the word there are many who believe that a meritocratic system is a good thing for society proponents of meritocracy argue that a meritocratic system is more just and more productive than other systems and that it allows for an end to distinctions based on such things as sex and race though social classes would still exist young s central criticism of meritocracy was that a system in which social position is determined by objective characteristics would still be inegalitarian and unstable there have since been other lines of criticism proponents of critical theory often argue that merit is defined by the power elite simply to legitimise a system in which social status is actually determined by class birth and wealth often opponents of the concept of meritocracy argue that characteristics such as intelligence or effort are simply impossible to measure accurately for example one may ask who was more intelligent isaac newton or albert einstein therefore in their view any implementation of meritocracy necessarily involves a high degree of guesswork and is inherently flawed social darwinism social darwinism is a social theory which holds that darwin s theory of evolution by natural selection is not only a model for the development of biological traits in a population but can also be applied to human social institutions social darwinisim was popular in the late one nine th century to the end of world war ii although some have claimed that contemporary sociobiology could be classified as a form of social darwinism proponents of social darwinism often used the theory to justify social inequality as being meritocratic others used it to justify racism and imperialism at its most extreme some social darwinism appears to anticipate eugenics and the race doctrines of the nazis while social darwinism applies the concept of evolution and natural selection to human cultural systems none of the political and quasi theological ideologies related to it are a part of darwin s biological theory of evolution equally social darwinism itself does not necessarily engender a political position some social darwinists argue for the inevitability of progress while others emphasize the potential for the degeneration of humanity some even attempted to enroll social darwinism in reformist politics the theory of social darwinism draws on the work of many authors including herbert spencer and thomas malthus individual proponents confucius in teaching there should be no distinction of classes analects xv three nine tr legge many western admirers of confucius like voltaire or h g creel have pointed out an innovative and revolutionary idea of confucius he replaced the nobility of blood with one of virtue j nz which had meant noble man slowly took on a new meaning in his sayings something like the english gentleman a virtuous plebeian who cultivates his qualities could be a gentleman whilst a shameless son of a king was only a small man that he allowed any kind of student to be his disciple his teachings were intended to train future rulers is a clear indication that he didn t wholly support feudal structures in chinese society han feizi in addition to confucius another ancient chinese philosopher of the same period the warring states advocated a meritocratic system of government and society this was han feizi who was famous as being the foremost proponent of the school of law otherwise known as the philosophy of legalism the central tenet of his argument was the absolute rule of law though there were also numerous meritocratic elements another legalist shang yang implemented legalist and meritocratic reforms in the state of qin by abolishing the aristocracy and promoting individuals based on skill intelligence and initiative this led to the armies of the qin having a critical edge over the other nations that adhered to old aristocratic systems of government legalism along with its anti aristocratic pro meritocratic ideals remained a key part of chinese philosophy and politics for another two millennia although after the qin dynasty it was heavily diluted genghis khan meritocracy was the primary basis for selection of chiefs and generals in the mongol empire genghis khan chose whomever was talented and fit for his military chain of command he even trusted generals and soldiers from opponents armies if they showed loyalty to their leaders for example genghis khan s general jebe had been an enemy soldier who had shot genghis s horse in battle before he became great khan napoleon napoleonic revolutionary france is also sometimes considered to have been meritocratic after the revolution of one seven nine two hardly a member of the former elite remained when napoleon rose to power therefore there was no ancient base from which to draw his staff and he had to choose the people he thought best for the job including officers from his army revolutionaries who had been in the people s assembly and even some former aristocrats such as prime minister talleyrand a later non meritocratic practice however was the appointment of family members and corsican friends to important positions specifically regional leadership loyalty may have been a more important factor than sheer merit in performance a common case in political situations meritocratic states singapore among modern nation states the republic of singapore claims to aspire to be a pure meritocracy with its supposed emphasis on identifying and grooming bright young citizens for positions of leadership there is also an emphasis on academic credentials these are seen as objective measures of both intelligence and effort which in turn are arbitrarily determined by the ruling party of singapore the people s action party its unwillingness to tolerate political dissent casts some skepticism on its claims of meritocracy and within its party ideology political conformity is a measure of merit thereby distorting its original meaning meritocracy is supposed to be a central political concept in singapore and is at the heart of its founding myth specifically singapore portrays itself as having been expelled from neighbouring malaysia in one nine six five as a result of the unwillingness of its majority immigrant groups especially the ethnic chinese to accept the special position of the indigenous communities especially the malays the federal malaysian government had argued for a system which would give special privileges to the malays as part of their birthright as an indigenous people in time the federal government came to implement an affirmative action policy that favoured the numerically preponderant but economically backward indigenous groups the singapore government supposedly argued for the equality of all citizens of malaysia with places in universities government contracts political appointments etc going to the most deserving candidate rather than to one chosen on the basis of connections or ethnic background in the ensuing conflict between state and federal governments through the machinations of the politicians of the day singapore was expelled and became an independent city state however the reality of the singaporean political and economic system is anything but meritocratic double standards exist even politically the only political activism seen since independence was when the government s interests aligned with those of the activists dissidents and seditious activities are not allowed the bulk of the singaporean economy comprises of government linked companies of which senior members of the people s action party are routinely selected to become directors and ceos in a non transparent fashion rather than focusing on other qualities that would determine merit such as experience in running large mncs and other more impressive credentials that other candidates may possess the most famous and oft cited example of singapore s alleged nepotism is that of temasek holdings inc the managing director of which the daughter in law of singapore s founding father lee kuan yew ho ching became when there was no shortage of other better qualified candidates grand duchy of finland another example is the one nine th century finland which was formally ruled by an autocrat though in practice governing was left to the educated class although ancestry and inherited wealth influenced one s educational opportunities education and not ancestry was the principal requirement for admittance to and promotion within the civil service and government well into the mid two zero th century academic degrees remained important factors for politicians asking for the electorate s confidence meritocratic civilization western civilization the anglosphere and western europe western civilization as a whole is based largely on principles of meritocracy the primary difference between the anglosphere and western europe being that anglophone countries focus on merit regardless of inherited advantages while continental countries prefer to assess merit after giving roughly the same opportunities to everyone the principles of equality under the law the system of common law the prevalence of the market system which rewards merit however achieved the democratic system whereby citizens can choose those they believe to be of the greatest merit and the strong constitutional emphasis on individual rights are all unique developments of western civilization which have the effect of approximating meritocracy better than traditional civilizations although a conflict exists between those who believe that everyone should have the same opportunities and those who believe the most capable should rule regardless of how they came to be the most capable western civilization is distinguished by its focus on individual merit over collectivism or state authority see also meritocracy in china participatory economics participatory democracy aristocracy consensus democracy majoritarianism nepotism racialism external links world wide words michael quinion writes about the changing use of the term forms of government political neologisms marxism leninism russian strictly speaking refers to the version of marxist theory developed by vladimir lenin see leninism however in various contexts different and sometimes opposing political groups have used the term marxism leninism to describe the ideologies that they claimed to be upholding the purpose of this article is to give an account of the historical and present uses of the label marxism leninism history of the term lenin himself never used the term leninism nor did he refer to his views as marxism leninism however his ideas diverged from classical marxist theory on several important points see the articles on marxism and leninism for more information bolshevik communists saw these differences as advancements of marxism made by lenin after lenin s death his ideology and contributions to marxist theory were termed marxism leninism or sometimes only leninism marxism leninism soon became the official name for the ideology of the comintern and of communist parties around the world within five years of lenin s death joseph stalin completed his rise to power in the soviet union stalin in contrast to many contemporary revolutionaries did not write a significant body of theoretical work stalinism strictly speaking refers to a style of government or political structure rather than an ideology per se during the period of stalin s rule in the soviet union marxism leninism was proclaimed the official ideology of the state whether stalin s practices actually followed the principles of marx and lenin is still a subject of debate amongst historians and political scientists trotskyists in particular believe that stalinism contradicted authentic marxism and leninism and they intitially used the term bolshevik leninism to describe their own ideology of anti stalinist and anti maoist communism after the sino soviet split the soviet union and the people s republic of china each claimed to be the sole intellectual heir to marxism leninism in china the claim that mao had adapted marxism leninism to chinese conditions evolved into the idea that he had updated it in a fundamental way applying to the world as a whole consequently the term marxism leninism mao zedong thought commonly known as maoism was increasingly used to describe the official chinese state ideology as well as the ideological basis of parties around the world who sympathized with the communist party of china following the death of mao american maoists associated with the revolutionary communist party usa subsequently coined the term marxism leninism maoism arguing that maoism was a more advanced stage of marxism maoist and maoist oriented parties today generally believe that the current leadership of china has abandoned maoism in north korea marxism leninism was officially superseded in one nine seven seven by juche in which concepts of class and class struggle in other words marxism itself play no significant role however the government is still sometimes referred to as marxist leninist or more commonly stalinist due to its political and economic structure see history of north korea the other three communist states existing today cuba vietnam and laos hold marxism leninism as their official ideology although they give it different interpretations in terms of practical policy current usage most communist parties continue to regard marxism leninism as their basic ideology although many have modified it to adapt to new political conditions several communist parties especially those previously associated with eurocommunism have distanced themselves from the concept of marxism leninism and in many cases omitted it from their official documents some have started identifying themselves as marxist leninist or marxist and leninist rather than marxist leninist the difference in such cases is that the historical connotation of marxism leninism is avoided in party names the appellation marxist leninist is normally used by a communist party who wishes to distinguish itself from some other and presumably mainstream communist party in the same country most often parties who place the term marxist leninist in their official name are those originating from the anti revisionist tradition such as maoist groups popular confusion abounds concerning the complex terminology describing the various schools of marxist derived thought the appellation marxist leninist is often used by those not familiar with communist ideology in any detail e g many newspapers and other media as a synonym for any kind of marxism communism political theories the word modulo is the latin ablative of modulus it was introduced into mathematics in the book disquisitiones arithmeticae by carl friedrich gauss in one eight zero one ever since however modulo has gained many meanings some exact and some imprecise this usage is from gauss s book given the integers a b and n the expression a b mod n pronounced a is congruent to b modulo n means that a and b have the same remainder when divided by n or equivalently that a b is a multiple of n for more details see modular arithmetic in computing given two integers a and n a modulo n is the remainder after numerical division of a by n under certain constraints see modulo operation two members of a ring or an algebra are congruent modulo an ideal if the difference between them is in the ideal two members a and b of a group are congruent modulo a normal subgroup iff ab one is a member of the normal subgroup see quotient group and isomorphism theorem two subsets of an infinite set are equal modulo finite sets precisely if their symmetric difference is finite that is you can take a finite piece from the first infinite set then add a finite piece to it and get as result the second infinite set the most general precise definition is simply in terms of an equivalence relation r we say that a is equivalent or congruent to b modulo r if arb in the mathematical community the word modulo is also used informally in many imprecise ways generally to say a is the same as b modulo c means more or less a and b are the same except for differences accounted for or explained by c see modulo jargon mathematical terminology the meritorious service medal is a senior level

five until one nine nine one his attempts at reform led to the end of the cold war but also caused the end of the political supremacy of the communist party of the soviet union cpsu and the dissolution of the soviet union he was awarded the nobel peace prize in one nine nine zero early life and political career mikhail gorbachev was born into a peasant family in the village of privolnoye near stavropol gorbachev studied law at moscow university where he met his future wife raisa they married in september one nine five three and moved to gorbachev s home region of stavropol in southern russia when he graduated in one nine five five gorbachev joined the cpsu in one nine five two at the age of two one in one nine six six at age three five he obtained a correspondence degree as an agronomist economist from the agricultural institute his career moved forward rapidly and in one nine seven zero he was appointed first secretary for agriculture and the following year made a member of the central committee in one nine seven two he headed a soviet delegation to belgium and two years later in one nine seven four he was made a representative to the supreme soviet and chairman of the standing commission on youth affairs in one nine seven nine gorbachev was promoted to the politburo there he received the patronage of yuri andropov head of the kgb and also a native of stavropol and was promoted during andropov s brief time as leader of the party before andropov s death in one nine eight four with responsibility over personnel working together with andropov two zero percent of the top echelon of government ministers and regional governors were replaced often with younger men during this time grigory romanov nikolai ryzhkov and yegor ligachev were elevated the latter two working closely with gorbachev ryzhkov on economics ligachev on personnel he was also close to konstantin chernenko andropov s successor serving as second secretary his positions within the new cpsu created more opportunities to travel abroad and this would profoundly affect his political and social views in the future as leader of the country in one nine seven five he led a delegation to west germany and in one nine eight three he headed a soviet delegation to canada to meet with prime minister pierre trudeau and members of the canadian house of commons and senate in one nine eight four he traveled to the united kingdom where he met with prime minister margaret thatcher general secretary of the cpsu upon the death of konstantin chernenko mikhail gorbachev at age five four was elected general secretary of the communist party on march one one one nine eight five he became the party s first leader to have been born after the russian revolution of one nine one seven as de facto ruler of the soviet union he tried to reform the stagnating communist party and the state economy by introducing glasnost openness perestroika restructuring and uskoreniye acceleration of economic development which were launched at the two seven th congress of the cpsu in february one nine eight six reforms and democratization gorbachev in one on one discussions with u s president ronald reagan domestic reforms domestically gorbachev implemented economic reforms that he hoped would improve living standards and worker productivity as part of his perestroika program however many of his reforms were considered radical at the time by orthodox apparatchiks in the soviet government in one nine eight five gorbachev announced that the soviet economy was stalled and that reorganization was needed initially his reforms were called uskoreniye acceleration but later the term perestroika reconstruction became much more popular the first reform introduced under gorbachev was the one nine eight five alcohol reform which was designed to fight wide spread alcoholism in the soviet union prices on vodka wine and beer were lifted and their sales were restricted people who were caught drunk at work or in public were prosecuted drinking on long distance trains and in public places was banned many famous wineries were destroyed scenes of alcohol consumption were cut out from the movies the reform did not have any significant effect on the alcoholism in the country but economically it was a complete disaster and a serious blow to the state budget a loss of approximately one zero zero billion rubles according to alexander yakovlev after alcohol production migrated to black market economy alcohol reform was one of the initial triggers that caused a chain of events that ended with the collapse of the soviet union and deep economical crisis in the newly formed cis six years later citation needed the law on cooperatives enacted in may one nine eight eight was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the gorbachev era for the first time since vladimir lenin s new economic policy the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the services manufacturing and foreign trade sectors the law initially imposed high taxes and employment restrictions but these were later revised to avoid discouraging private sector activity under this provision cooperative restaurants shops and manufacturers became part of the soviet scene gorbachev s introduction of glasnost gave new freedoms to the people such as a greater freedom of speech this was a radical change as control of speech and suppression of government criticism had previously been a central part of the soviet system the press became far less controlled and thousands of political prisoners and many dissidents were released gorbachev s goal in undertaking glasnost was to pressure conservatives within the cpsu who opposed his policies of economic restructuring and he also hoped that through different ranges of openness debate and participation the soviet people would support his reform initiatives in january one nine eight seven gorbachev called for democratization the infusion of democratic elements such as multi candidate elections into the soviet political process in june one nine eight eight at the cpsu s nineteenth party conference gorbachev launched radical reforms meant to reduce party control of the government apparatus in december one nine eight eight the supreme soviet approved the establishment of a congress of people s deputies which constitutional amendments had established as the soviet union s new legislative body elections to the congress were held throughout the ussr in march and april one nine eight nine on march one five one nine nine zero gorbachev was elected as the first executive president of the soviet union time magazine cover of january four one nine eight eight featuring gorbachev as man of the year new thinking abroad in international affairs gorbachev sought to improve relations and trade with the west he established close relationships with several western leaders such as margaret thatcher who famously remarked i like mr gorbachev we can do business together west german chancellor helmut kohl and u s president ronald reagan on october one one one nine eight six gorbachev and reagan met in reykjav k iceland to discuss reducing intermediate range nuclear weapons in europe this led to the signing of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty inf in one nine eight seven in february one nine eight eight gorbachev announced the withdrawal of soviet forces from afghanistan the withdrawal was completed the following year although the civil war continued as the mujahedin pushed to overthrow the pro soviet najibullah regime an estimated one five zero zero zero soviets were killed between one nine seven nine and one nine eight nine as a result of the conflict see soviet war in afghanistan also during one nine eight eight gorbachev announced that the soviet union would abandon the brezhnev doctrine and allow the eastern bloc nations to determine their own internal affairs this proved to be the most far reaching of gorbachev s foreign policy reforms with his foreign ministry spokesman gennadi gerasimov jokingly calling his new doctrine the sinatra doctrine moscow s abandonment of the brezhnev doctrine led to a string of revolutions in eastern europe throughout one nine eight nine in which communism collapsed with the exception of romania the popular upheavals against the pro soviet communist regimes were all peaceful ones see revolutions of one nine eight nine the loosening of soviet hegemony over eastern europe effectively ended the cold war and for this gorbachev was awarded the nobel peace prize on october one five one nine nine zero the new encyclop dia britannica labelled gorbachev the single most important initiator of a series of events in late one nine eight nine and one nine nine zero that transformed the political fabric of europe and marked the beginning of the end of the cold war ronald reagan nancy reagan raisa gorbachyova and mikhail gorbachev december eight one nine eight seven coup and collapse while gorbachev s political initiatives were positive for freedom and democracy in the soviet union and eastern europe the economic policy of his government gradually brought the country close to disaster by the end of one nine eight zero s severe shortages of basic food supplies meat sugar led to reintroduction of the war time system of distribution using food cards that limited each citizen to a certain amount of product per month compared to one nine eight five state deficit grew from zero to one zero nine billion rubles gold funds decreased from two zero zero zero to two zero zero tonn and external debt grew from zero to one two zero billion dollars furthermore the democratization of the ussr and eastern europe had irreparably undermined the power of the cpsu and gorbachev himself gorbachev s relaxation of censorship and attempts to create more political openness had the unintended effect of re awakening long suppressed nationalist and anti russian feelings in the soviet republics calls for greater independence from moscow s rule grew louder especially in the baltic republics of estonia lithuania and latvia which had been annexed into the soviet union by stalin in one nine four zero nationalist feeling also took hold in the soviet republics of georgia ukraine armenia and azerbaijan gorbachev had unleashed a force that would ultimately destroy the soviet union gorbachev s response to growing republic separatism was to draw up a new treaty of union which would have created a truly voluntary federation in an increasingly democratised ussr the new treaty was strongly supported by the central asian republics who needed the economic power and markets of the soviet union to prosper however the more radical reformists such as russian sfsr president boris yeltsin were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition to a market economy was required and were more than happy to contemplate the disintegration of the ussr if that was required to achieve their aims gorbachev accused boris yeltsin his old rival and russia s first post soviet president of tearing the country apart out of a desire to advance his own personal interests in contrast to the reformers lukewarm approach to the new treaty the hard line apparatchiks still strong within the cpsu and military establishment were completely opposed to anything which might lead to breakup of the soviet motherland on the eve of the treaty s signing the hardliners struck hard liners in the soviet leadership launched the august coup in one nine nine one in an attempt to remove gorbachev from power and prevent the signing of the new union treaty during this time gorbachev spent three days august one nine to two one under house arrest at a dacha in the crimea before being freed and restored to power however upon his return gorbachev found that neither union nor russian power structures heeded his commands as support had swung over to yeltsin whose defiance had led to the coup s collapse furthermore gorbachev was forced to fire large numbers of his politburo and in several cases arrest them those arrested for high treason include the gang of eight that had led the coup gorbachev had aimed to maintain the cpsu as a united party but move it in the direction of social democracy the inherent contradictions in this approach praising lenin admiring sweden s social model and seeking to maintain the annexation of the baltic states by military force were difficult enough but when the cpsu was proscribed after the august coup gorbachev was left with no effective power base beyond the armed forces in the end yeltsin won them round too with promises of more money gorbachev eventually resigned on december two five one nine nine one as the ussr was officially dissolved gorbachev is generally well regarded in the west for having ended the cold war however in russia his reputation is very low because he is perceived to have brought about the collapse of the country and is held responsible for the economic misery that followed nevertheless polls indicate that a majority of russians are pleased with the result of the individual aims of perestroika gorbachev s chief legislative legacy and the freedom that came about as a result nor is he considered by all to be the sole reason the cold war ended as it did the war in afghanistan had been going on since the late one nine seven zero s draining soviet resources this and many revolutionary movements in soviet satellite states well funded and supplied by clandenstine operations from the west most notably afghanistan and poland took a huge toll on the union s ability to keep order and operate as a government armament buildups in the west also prompted likewise military expenditures that when added to expenditures in afghanistan could not be maintained soviet economy infrastructure was in serious decay by one nine eight five when gorbachev took office and these events would have had a huge impact on gorbachev s decisions to liberalize in the end these attempts to open the soviet union were too little too late and satellite nations responded accordingly ending a nearly five zero year stalemate between east and west political activity after resignation gorbachev founded the gorbachev foundation in one nine nine two in one nine nine three he also founded green cross international of which he was one of three major sponsors of the earth charter he also became a member of the club of rome in one nine nine six gorbachev re ran for president in russia but only received about one of the vote most likely due to his animosity following the soviet union s collapse in one nine nine seven gorbachev starred in a pizza hut commercial made for the usa to raise money for the perestroika archives on november two six two zero zero one gorbachev also founded the social democratic party of russia which is a union between several russian social democrat parties he resigned as party leader in may two zero zero four over a disagreement with the party s chairman over the direction taken in the december two zero zero three election campaign in early two zero zero four gorbachev moved to trademark his famous port wine birthmark after a vodka company featured the mark on labels of one of their drinks to capitalize on its fame the company now no longer uses the trademark gorbachev to trademark his forehead in june two zero zero four gorbachev represented russia at the funeral of ronald reagan in september two zero zero four following chechen militant attacks across russia president vladimir putin launched an initiative to replace the election of regional governors with a system whereby they would be directly appointed by the president and approved by regional legislatures gorbachev together with boris yeltsin criticized putin s actions as a step away from democracy in two zero zero five gorbachev was awarded the point alpha prize for his role in supporting german reunification he also received an honorary doctorate from the university of m nster he currently resides in moscow trivia in the west gorbachev was colloquially known as gorby in part because of a perception that he was less austere than his predecessors in one nine eight seven gorbachev acknowledged that his liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika owed a great deal to alexander dub ek s socialism with a human face when asked what the difference was between the prague spring and his own reforms gorbachev replied nineteen years in one nine eight nine on an official visit to china during the demonstrations in tiananmen square shortly before the imposition of martial law in beijing gorbachev was asked for his opinion on the great wall of china it s a very beautiful work he replied but there are already too many walls between people a journalist asked him would you like the berlin wall to be taken down gorbachev replied very seriously why not gorbachev was ranked nine five on michael h hart s list of the most influential figures in history gorbachev is the mascot to a small unorthodox support group in virginia known as kajn and serves as a symbol of their unity and love for mother russia he is also a recurring cameo in many of their short independent films gorbachev makes a bizarre cameo in the arcade game street

ready for battle in a minute s notice the term minutemen has also been applied to various later united states military units to recall the success and patriotism of the originals see minutemen history as early as one six four five in the massachusetts bay colony some men were selected from the general ranks of town based training bands to be ready for rapid deployment the militia in the province of massachusetts had a long history of extended conflict see king philip s war french and indian wars and battle of lexington and concord every generation of new englander had known fighting every town had a militia and every man between one six and six zero years of age was asked to join most of these men were farmers many were descendants of the few original settlers of each town and so it was very common to be fighting alongside cousins and in laws some towns in massachusetts had a long history of designating a portion of their militia as minutemen but others prefered to keep their entire militia in a single unit after the powder alarm in the fall of one seven seven four patriot leaders in the newly formed massachusetts provincial congress recommended that all militias contain minute companies special units within the militia system whose members underwent additional training and to hold themselves ready to turn out quickly at a minute s notice for emergencies some towns followed this recommendation and altered their unit structures but some took no action the minutemen were usually two five years of age or younger and they were chosen for their enthusiasm reliability and strength they were the first armed militia to arrive or await a battle officers were elected by popular vote and each unit drafted a formal written covenant to be signed upon enlistment they typically assembled four times per year for training during peacetime it was common sometimes even in the middle of battle for officers to make decisions through consultation with their men as opposed to giving orders to be followed without question popular histories of the battle of lexington and concord in one seven seven five the first battle of the american revolutionary war have often labelled all the irregulars on the american side as minutemen most notably captain john parker s lexington militia but at the time of the battle all of lexington s militiamen were organized into a single large unit and were still called by the archaic name of town training band other colonies faced with similar problems had organized similar minute companies over time minutemen became a generic term for any american militia motivation the new england town meeting style of local decision making in combination with the colonial legislature meant that for nearly all functions of government these men had already experienced generations of self rule even though most of them could not express lofty sentiments about the rights of man and the purposes of government they knew that the same british army of professional soldiers who had once fought with them against a common enemy was now in their land to take something important away from them one massachusetts man used the phrase an englishman s home is his castle when he explained to his friends why he had barricaded himself behind his front door to fight the british army as it passed by during the final phase of the battle of lexington and concord the typical individual american patriot in massachusetts fought for a political idea even at this first stage of the war when independence from great britain was not yet a common sentiment equipment training and tactics most colonial militia units were provided neither arms nor uniforms and so had to equip themselves many simply wore their own farmers or workmans clothes while others had buckskin hunting outfits some added indian style touches to intimidate the enemy even including war paint most used hunting rifles which did not have bayonets but were accurate at long range the continental army regulars received european style military training later in the american revolutionary war but the militias did not get much of this rather than fight formal battles in the traditional dense lines and columns they were better when used as irregulars primarily as skirmishers and sharpshooters their experience suited irregular warfare most were familiar with frontier hunting the indian wars and especially the recent french and indian war had taught both the men and officers the value of irregular warfare while many british troops fresh from europe were less familiar with this the wilderness terrain that lay just beyond many colonial towns very familiar to the local minuteman favored this style of combat the rifled musket used by most minutemen was also well suited to this role the rifling grooves inside the barrel gave it a much greater range than the smoothbore musket although it took much longer to load because of the lower rate of fire rifles weren t used by regular infantry but were preferred for hunting when performing as skirmishers the minutemen could fire and fall back behind cover or other troops before the british could get into range the increased range and accuracy of the rifle along with a lifetime of hunting to develop marksmanship earned minutemen sharpshooters a deadly reputation ammunition and supplies were not only in short demand but were constantly being seized by british patrols as a precaution these items were often hidden or left behind by minutemen in fields or wooded areas other popular concealment methods were to hide items underneath floorboards in houses and barns legacy concord minuteman in commemoration of the centenary of the first successful armed resistance to british forces daniel chester french in his first major commission produced one of his most well known statues along with the lincoln memorial the concord minuteman inscribed on the pediment is the opening stanza of ralph waldo emerson s one eight three seven concord hymn with the immortal words shot heard round the world traditionally the statue s likeness is said to be based on isaac davis the captain of the acton militia

ushistory org organization of the minute men american revolutionary war militias masada is a latin corruption of the hebrew name metzada derived from the word metzuda meaning fortress it is the site of ancient palaces and fortifications in israel on top of an isolated rock plateau on the eastern edge of the judean desert overlooking the dead sea masada became famous for the seven three ce battle one of the last in the great jewish revolt between the site s jewish defenders and besieging roman troops during which almost all surviving defenders committed mass suicide when defeat became imminent geography masada seen from the east dovecote at masada where ashes were probably stored the openings have been shown to be too small for pigeons to fit the cliffs on the east edge of masada are about four five zero meters high dropping off to the dead sea and the cliffs on the west are about one zero zero meters high the natural approaches to the cliff top are very difficult the top of the plateau is flat and rhomboid shaped approximately six zero zero by three zero zero meters there was a casemate wall around the top of the plateau totalling one four zero zero meters long and four meters thick with many towers and the fortress included storehouses cisterns that were refilled by rainwater barracks palaces and an armory three narrow winding paths led from below to fortified gates location history according to flavius josephus a one st century jewish historian herod the great fortified masada between three seven and three one bce as a refuge for himself should his jewish subjects rise up against him in six six ce at the beginning of the great jewish revolt against the romans a group of jewish rebels called the zealots heb kana im lit jealous ones commanded by elazar ben ya ir took masada from the roman garrison stationed there in seven zero ce they were joined by additional zealots and their families who were expelled from jerusalem by the other jews living there shortly before the destruction of jerusalem and for the next two years used masada as their base for raiding and harassing roman and jewish settlements alike remnants of one of several legionary camps at masada just outside the circumvallation wall which can be seen next to it then in seven two ce the roman governor of iudaea province lucius flavius silva marched against masada with the roman legion x fretensis and laid siege to the fortress after failed attempts to breach the wall they built a circumvallation wall and then a rampart against the western face of the plateau using thousands of tons of stones and beaten earth josephus does not record any major attempts by the zealots to counterattack the besiegers during this process a significant difference from his accounts of other sieges against jewish fortresses suggesting that perhaps the zealots lacked the equipment or skills to fight the roman legion it is believed by many that the romans used jewish slaves to build the rampart whom the zealots were reluctant to kill because of their beliefs a shot of the ramp from the top the ramp was complete in the spring of seven three ce after approximately two to three months of siege allowing the romans to finally breach the wall of the fortress with a battering ram when they entered the fortress however the romans discovered that its approximately one thousand defenders had set all the buildings but the food storerooms ablaze and committed mass suicide rather than face certain capture or defeat by their enemies because the jewish religion discourages the act of suicide however the defenders were reported to have drawn lots and slain each other in turn down to the last man who would be the only one to actually take his own life as per josephus account the argument is made that the storerooms were left standing to s
